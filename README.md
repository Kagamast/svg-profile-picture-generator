# svg-profile-picture-generator
A program, that lets you generate variations of profile pictures. By default, the color of the picture is #abcdef, but you can specify any color you want in the url. The url can take in two arguments:

"color"-specify what color you want the profile picture to be, it accepts hex values (just make sure to leave out the #),

the other one is "variant" -specify, which varaiant of the face you want. 


# an example url:
svg.php?color=aadd44&variant=1
